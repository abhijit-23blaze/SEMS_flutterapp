# SEMS - Smart Electricity Management System ⚡📱

A novel IoT-based electricity management system that automatically controls electrical appliances based on user proximity detection using WiFi signals. Developed for ICDCIT (International Conference on Distributed Computing and Intelligent Things) and presented at KIIT Bhubaneswar.


## 🏆 Achievement

**🥈 1st Runner-up at ICDCIT'24** - Selected and invited to KIIT Bhubaneswar for live demonstration among top submissions from across the globe.

## ✨ Features

### 🔌 Smart Appliance Control
- **Automatic Control**: Turn appliances on/off based on user presence
- **WiFi-Based Detection**: Uses existing WiFi infrastructure for proximity sensing
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live status of all connected devices
- **Energy Analytics**: Track electricity consumption and savings

### 📱 Mobile App (Flutter)
- **Device Management**: Control and monitor all smart sockets
- **Usage Statistics**: Detailed energy consumption reports
- **Remote Control**: Manual override for appliances
- **Notifications**: Alerts for energy savings and device status

### 🏢 Perfect for Hostels & Workplaces
- **Hostel Rooms**: Automatically turn off lights/fans when students leave
- **Office Spaces**: Save energy in meeting rooms and workstations
- **Common Areas**: Smart control for shared spaces
- **Scalable Solution**: Works from single rooms to entire buildings

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Mobile App** | Flutter + Dart |
| **Backend** | Firebase Firestore |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Auth |
| **Real-time Data** | Firebase Realtime Database |
| **Hardware** | ESP32/Arduino with WiFi modules |
| **Communication** | MQTT/HTTP protocols |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **WiFi Signal Detection**: System monitors WiFi signal strength from user devices
2. **Proximity Analysis**: Algorithm determines if user is present in the room
3. **Smart Decision**: Automatically controls electrical appliances based on presence
4. **Mobile Control**: Flutter app provides manual override and monitoring
5. **Energy Tracking**: System logs usage patterns and calculates savings
